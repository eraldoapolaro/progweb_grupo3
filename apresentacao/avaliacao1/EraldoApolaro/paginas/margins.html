    <h2>CSS Margins</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.</li>
        <li>With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).</li>
        <li>CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element</li>
        <li>To shorten the code, it is possible to specify all the margin properties in one property.</li>
        <li>You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.</li>
        <li>The element will then take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and right margins.</li>
        
    </ul>
