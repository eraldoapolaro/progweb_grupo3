    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
        <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
        <li>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
        <li>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</li>
        <li>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page</li>
        <li>When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</li>
